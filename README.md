The goal of this analysis was to formulate a strategy for the Democrats that would lead them to victory in the upcoming 2020 election. First, we identify which states could be considered as the 'swing states' - that is, the states on which they should focus the most during the campaign. Next, we create a profile of an average Trump supporter based on the 2016 primary election data. Lastly, we stablish which 'swing states' populations don't really fit this profile. These voters could be the easiest to sway away from voting for Trump.
